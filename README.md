# Vanding-Machine

I wrote this one to simulate a program from a 'Vanding Machine'.
It will display all the menius on the console and you can add/delete products in "vanding machine", you can see what kind of 
money is in the machine, when you want to buy a product you need to put in what kind of money you will use and the number of
those, because if you buy something cheeper then your input money, the machine will give you the rest of it.

This 'Vanding Machine' simulator is was created in XCode in C++.
